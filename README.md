Hi, my name is Henry Cantrell. I'm currently a computer science student at the University of North Georgia, with an intended graduation date of 12/2022. 

I also consider myself a web development enthusiast and an aspiring professional in that field! My current skills, as reflected in my project experience, are in:

+ Node/Express
+ Javascript/React
+ CSS/HTML
+ Ruby/Rails

Computer science and software development have proven to be activities that I have a burning passion for. 
My interests within the field include web development and also expanding my knowledge by doing fun projects and networking with interesting people! I'm
always thinking of new stuff to work on, or upgrades I can make to older projects. Learning best practices for a new tool or a unique, better way to do something
I thought I already knew how to do never fails to make that 'lightbulb' light up in my brain.

My LinkedIn is: https://www.linkedin.com/in/henry-cantrell

My email is: hencan.1997@gmail.com and I am currently open to any and all internship or employment opportunities.

I consider the pins below to be a project portfolio showcasing my coding interests and abilities. Feel free to take a look!

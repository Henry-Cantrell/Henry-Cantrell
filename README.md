Hi, my name is Henry Cantrell. I'm a computer science student at the University of North Georgia, with an intended graduation date around 12/2022.

Computer science and software development has proven itself to be a burning personal passion that I deeply enjoy. 
My interests within the field include web development and also expanding my knowledge by doing fun projects and networking with interesting people! I'm
always thinking of new stuff to work on, or upgrades I can make to older projects.

My LinkedIn can be found here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/henry-cantrell-29724918a/

I can easily be reached through there, or via hencan.1997@gmail.com. Very open to employment/internship opportunities.

Hi, my name is Henry Cantrell. 

I'm a computer science student at the University of North Georgia, with an intended graduation date around 12/2022. 

Computer science and software development have proven to be activities that I have a burning passion for. 
My interests within the field include web development and also expanding my knowledge by doing fun projects and networking with interesting people! I'm
always thinking of new stuff to work on, or upgrades I can make to older projects. Learning best practices for a new tool or a unique, better way to do something
I thought I already knew how to do never fails to make that 'lightbulb' light up in my brain.

My LinkedIn can be found here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/henry-cantrell-29724918a/

I can easily be reached through there, or via hencan.1997@gmail.com. Open to any and all employment/internship opportunities.

Also open to collaborative projects if anyone shows interest. Once again, reach out via the above methods (email/linkedin) and I'll consider your proposal if I have the time or interest.
